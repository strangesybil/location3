    <h3>acknowledgements</h3>
    <div class="thanks">location, location, location was made possible by Fordham’s Duffy Fellowship, under the careful guidance of david gibson and olivia proust, who shepherded me through the writing and rehearsal process with a kind and gentle hand. the recording process was facilitated by sanjay menon, who’s technical guidance was both vital and nurturing. to gia and elian, who brought miriam and richie to life so brilliantly, thank you. to my friends: thank you for the endless encouragement, hand-holding and love. i am so lucky to have you. to luca scandella, who not only recorded the introduction to the play and embarked on his own version of an artist’s residency during the rehearsal process - you have all my love, always. this play is a love letter to my neighbourhood, which saw me through the very worst and best of my twenties (i hope). I miss my little house & the five weird guys who came with it (and one girl).</div>
